# Plex file organizer

*Programming: How to turn a 3 hour task into a 3 month project!*

## Description

This is a script I wrote mainly for educational purposes (teach myself about regexes essentially) but also for personal use to automate the task of renaming loads of downloaded files of TV shows to fit the Plex File Template. Instead of doing all that by hand, this script will figure out the showtitle, season, and episode of each file and organize them accordingly in a neat template, with options to also delete unneccessary files and folders afterwords.
